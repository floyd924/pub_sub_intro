Okay as a quick recap:
we need a file called helpers/pub_sub.js which has a publish and a subscribe function that we can call from the other files

the other files must require in the pub_sub file in order to call these functions

theses functions:
 >> allow the file to ‘broadcast’ some info on a ‘channel’ with a unique name, for anything to listen to

 >> and allow the file to ‘listen’ to the broadcasted frequency from wherever it comes from

The two functions above are wrapped in a method called ‘bindEvents’ when referred to inside each file wishing to use them

Each file’s ‘bindEvent’ methods must be called from the app.js file, in the main EventListener (within DOMContentLoaded)

Each file must be required at the top of the app.js file, but the pub_sub file doesn’t need to be.


And that’s it. Read over this tonight.
